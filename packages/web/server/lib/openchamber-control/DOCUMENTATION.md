# OpenChamber Control Service

## Purpose

This module owns the typed control contract shared by the OpenChamber CLI and
the managed OpenCode `openchamber` tool. Both adapters delegate to
`createOpenChamberControlService()`; neither adapter may call or spawn the
other.

## Boundaries

- `service.js` validates and executes the fixed project, model, session, and
  scheduled-task action allowlist. `actions.js` marks CLI-only actions with
  `agentExposed: false` (currently `schedule.status`); the agent tool consumes
  the filtered `OPENCHAMBER_AGENT_TOOL_*` exports. `schedule.toggle` requires
  the `disabled` boolean and replaces separate enable/disable actions;
  `schedule.list` also returns scheduler status as `scheduler`.
- `routes.js` is the authenticated CLI HTTP adapter. It forwards one action,
  preserves service status and partial-result details, and propagates request
  cancellation.
- `../agent-tool/runtime.js` is the managed-tool adapter. It wraps service
  results in the versioned native-tool envelope and uses a separate ephemeral
  loopback credential.
- `../openchamber-sessions/routes.js` and `../scheduled-tasks/service.js` own
  their domain operations and are composed into this service.

## Invariants

- Session status and messages come from official directory-scoped OpenCode
  APIs. Message output includes only ordered `text` parts.
- Wait never treats an initial idle response as completion after dispatch. It
  requires observed activity or a newly completed assistant message.
- Timeout and cancellation are failures, never authoritative idle results.
- Validation that protects side effects runs before session creation or
  dispatch.
- Send and fork dispatches without an explicit model/agent/variant reuse the
  target session's last user-message selection before falling back to the
  configured defaults; only session creation resolves defaults directly.
- Usage errors name the missing or conflicting input so CLI and agent-tool
  callers can correct an invalid request without an upfront usage manual.
- Explicit `projectId` or `directory` scope takes precedence over the managed
  tool's current-session directory fallback; the fallback never creates a
  conflicting second scope.
- One failed directory status lookup produces `unknown` for only that
  directory and does not erase other session results.
- Destructive session/worktree deletion and project-path registration are not
  part of the action contract.
